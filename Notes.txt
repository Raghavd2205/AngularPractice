                                                Angular Notes

* We use selectors in angular which starts with app like app-header, just because it should not match the inbuilt components of angular. we can use anything instead of app and then component name.

* <img [src]="imageUrl" [alt]="imageDesc"> this is the example of property binding 

* we can use get keyword in ts for creating a function and use that function in property binding. ex : ts --> get imageValue(){return `${imagedescd}/asset`}
               html --> <img [src] = "imageValue">

* Angular uses zone.js for change detection machnisam (detect data change and show in ui)
